## 🚀 Overview

Mail PreSync is a macOS utility designed to eliminate the usual pitfalls and last-minute regrets when sending emails. We've all experienced it: forgetting the subject, missing recipients, sending without attachments, or even sending the wrong version of a document. Mail PreSync watches your outgoing messages in Apple Mail and prompts you with reminders or checks *just before* you send, ensuring you don’t send something incomplete or sloppy.

Instead of relying on memory or manual checklists, Mail PreSync allows you to specify rules, such as:

- remind if subject is blank or generic (e.g. "Hello" or "No Subject")  
- remind if there are recipients in the body but not in To/Cc  
- remind if you mention “attached” or “attachment” in the body but no file is attached  
- warn if sending to large number of recipients or external domains  

The app works quietly in the background; it intercepts the send action in Apple Mail, runs through your defined checks, presents any warnings or suggestions, and then allows you to proceed or cancel the send. It’s ideal for professionals, students, anyone sending important emails, or just people who want to reduce email mistakes.

Mail PreSync supports per-account settings, custom warning messages, and optional delays (e.g., hold for 5 seconds before send, giving you time to recheck). It integrates smoothly and doesn’t change your existing workflows — just adds a safety net. For senders, this means fewer embarrassing errors, more polished communications, and more peace of mind.
